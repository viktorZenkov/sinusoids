<h1>Cells moving in the liver sinusoids represented as graphs</h1>

  <h2>Specific T cells kill malaria parasites. How do they find the parasites (hunting or random movement)? 
    Prior results were only partially conclusive (some cells appeared to hunt under some circumstances), so we model the liver sinusoids as a graph and cell paths as walks on the graph.</h2> 
    <h2>On this page, we see gifs of paths of cells (<span style="color: rgb(255,0,0)">red</span>, lightening over time) and parasite (<span style="color: rgb(0,150,0)">green</span>) over time, with the i'th image in the animation containing all paths of cells up to timepoint i.</h2>
