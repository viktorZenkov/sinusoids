<h1>Cells moving in the liver</h1>

  <p>Specific T cells kill malaria parasites. How do they find the parasites (hunting or random movement)? Prior results were only partially conclusive, so we model the liver sinusoids as a graph and cell paths as walks on the graph. On this page, we see gifs of paths of cells (red, lightening over time) and parasite (green) over time, with the i'th image in the animation containing all paths of cells up to timepoint i.</p>
